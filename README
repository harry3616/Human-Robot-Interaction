# Abstract
In order to make the robot more natural like humans, especially the daily conversation and so on.
In this paper, a method of different rotation angles of the robot head, body and the order between
the dialogues is proposed and analyzed to verify the relationship between the movement of the head,
body position and the sense of the conversation. According to the recording of the experimental film
and the rotation angle data of the head and body position during the man-machine dialogue.
The analysis results show that speaking while turning the head and body during the pronunciation 
of the robot not only expresses natural human behavior, such as expressing a respect for the other party, but also indicating that the degree of sentence comprehension. Discussed the turning angle to the 
natural sense of human perception, with future studies about other head movements like nodding
and gimmick silence, etc., Those factors can also enhance the fluency of voice information in the robot.
